       <h1> The history of automobile diagnosis reflects the evolution of automotive technology and the growing complexity of vehicles. <br> Diagnostic tools and methods have developed from basic mechanical checks to sophisticated electronic systems, mirroring advances in automotive engineering. <br> Here’s a detailed overview of the history of automobile diagnosis:</h1>

       <h3> 
        <ul> 
            <li>Early Mechanical Diagnosis (Before 1980s)</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
        
        <ul> 
            <li>Pre-1970s: Mechanical Diagnostics</li>
            <li>Basic Tools and Techniques: Early automobile diagnostics relied on manual tools and visual inspections. Mechanics used wrenches, screwdrivers, and other hand tools to troubleshoot issues.</li>
            <li>Experience-Based Diagnosis: Diagnosis was largely based on the mechanic's experience and intuition. Problems were identified through symptoms like engine noise, exhaust smoke, or performance</li>
            <li>>Manual Adjustments: Mechanic adjustments involved carburetor tuning, ignition timing, and valve adjustments. There were no advanced diagnostic tools; issues were often fixed through trial and error.</li>
           </ul>
       
        
       <h3> 
        <ul>
